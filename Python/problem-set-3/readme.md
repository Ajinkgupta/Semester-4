**Python Program Set 3**

**Python functions** 

1.  **Write a Python function to find the Max of three numbers.**
    
2.  **Write a Python program to reverse a string.** 
    
    1.  **Sample String : "1234abcd"  
        Expected Output : "dcba4321"**
        
3.  **Write a Python function that checks whether a passed string is palindrome or not.** 
    
4.  **Write a Python program to make a chain of function decorators (bold, italic, underline etc.) in Python.**
    
5.  **Write a program that asks the user for two numbers. Then ask them if they would like to add, subtract, divide, or multiply these numbers. Perform the chosen operation on the values, showing the operation being performed. Write four functions, one for each mathematicaloperation.  
    Example: add(), subtract(), Multiply(), and Divide()**
    
6.  **Write a program that will give suggested footwear based on the weather.  
    Ask the user for the weather outside with three options (sunny, rainy, or snowy) and give the correct footwear suggestion (sneaker, gumboot, or boots). Each option should be written as its own function that prints a message based on the input. Expected output:**
